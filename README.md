# GameJoy - Lets create a game that can spread joy!

It's been too long since we had a community challenge, but that will change from today!

From the **2/12 - 16/12** the participants of this challenge will work in **groups of 3-4 people** on **creating a game that brings joy** 😊

## So what should the game do?

That is completely up to you! The only requirements are:

- What you build should **be a game** 📱 
- What you build should **bring joy** 😊 
- What you build should **be online** 🌍 

## What will i get out of it?

These are some things you will get out of joining:

- What will you get out of joining?
- Stronger network across the HackYourFuture community
- Work on your entrepreneurial mindset 
- Learn how to deploy your site to the web
- Learn how to work together with multiple people

## So what is a game? 

Hmm that's a good question and probably not one that i can answer

But here are some examples
- Letting a user guess a random number between 1-10
- A game where the more words you write the higher a score you get
- A game where you get a point for each second you press and hold space
- Maybe some of you could even make a multiplayer game!

## But i don't have time for all these schenanigans!

Fair enough, we know everyone is busy and this challenge is **not mandatory**. Join if you feel you have some time and motivation to do this.

You decide how much time you want to spend on this! There is no minimum time. As long as you talk with your group about your time constraints.

## Okay, sounds like fun, how can i join?

If you want to join then message Benjamin on slack. Then he will put together the groups and announce them on slack

## Will there be prices and judges?

Yes 🏆 and Yes 👩‍⚖️

## Working together

It's up to your group to decide how you will work together! Maybe one person is doing the styling, and the two other people is working on the game logic. Maybe you are all working on the game logic. 

The most important thing here is to focus on creating a game!
