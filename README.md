# GameJoy - Lets create a game that can spread joy!

It's been too long since we had a community challenge, but that will change from today!

From the 30/11 - 14/12 the participants will work in groups on creating a game that brings joy ðŸ˜Š

## So what should the GameJoy do?

That completely up to you! 

The only requirements are:
1. What you build should be a game
1. What you build should bring joy
1. What you build should be online

So what is a game? Hmm that's a good question and probably not one that i can answer, but here are some examples
- Guessing a random number between 1-10
- A game where the more words you write the higher a score you get
- A game where you get a point for each second you press and hold space
- Maybe some of you could even make a multiplayer game!

## But i don't have time for fun schenanigans!

Fair enough, we know everyone is busy and this challenge is **not mandatory**. Join if you feel you have some time and motivation to do this.

You decide how much time you want to spend on this! There is no minimum time. As long as you talk with your group about your time constraints.

## Okay, sounds like fun, how can i join?

If you want to join then message me on slack
